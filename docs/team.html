Hi, I’m Finley, I’m 17, and I’m the CEO & Co-Founder of NEXT DESIGN. Prior to starting Next Design I ran a marketing agency for two years, which taught me a lot about business, clients, and what it really takes to help companies grow online. During that time, I realised I wanted to focus on something more specific — combining my love for design with helping businesses succeed online. That’s how I founded NEXT DESIGN.<br><br>

At NEXT DESIGN, I handle everything outside of the design and development — from sales and client relationships to strategy and growth. For me, communication is everything. Being clear, honest, and approachable with clients ensures we deliver websites that don’t just look good, but actually help their business grow.<br><br>

<span class="meet-fin-txt" id="finReadMore" onclick="expandFinTxt()">Show more<br><br></span>

I genuinely love seeing the impact of our work — helping businesses build an online presence, attract clients, and achieve their goals is what motivates me every day. Being a young entrepreneur gives me a fresh perspective, modern ideas, and a drive to make every project successful.<br><br>

My goal is for NEXT DESIGN to grow into more than just a web design agency — eventually becoming a full digital partner, helping clients not only with websites, but also with their whole online presence and other online growth tools. At the end of the day, it’s all about helping people and their businesses succeed online, and that’s what keeps me excited about every project we take on.<br><br>

                       I am deeply passionate about web design and development, crafting websites that are not only visually clean but also highly functional. Every project I approach is guided by precision and care, reflecting a commitment to excellence and the pursuit of truth in every line of code and interface decision.<br><br>
                       Beyond design, I specialize in backend systems, creating efficient and reliable architectures that power complex applications. My work is built on structure, clarity, and faith in God, striving to create websites shaped by creativity, and built with honest craftsmanship, while making sure every solution serves people simply, efficiently, and with integrity at the centre.
